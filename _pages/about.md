I completed my PhD in [Pattern Recognition](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/) from the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), where I was advised by [Tieniu Tan](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/column/item80.shtml) during 2012-2017. I am currently an Associate Professor of the [New Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/), CASIA. I am a member of IEEE, CCF, CAAI, etc. I am also a member of technical executive committee on Digital Forensics and Security of [CSIG](https://www.csig.org.cn/), technical committee (TC) on Computer Vision of [CCF](https://www.ccf.org.cn/), TC on Pattern Recognition of [CAAI](https://www.caai.cn/), etc. My current research interests include artificial intelligence and its security problem, image and video forensics and privacy, and information content security.
